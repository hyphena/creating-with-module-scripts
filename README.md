Using module scripts to create an event system that allows players to unlock chests using keys. Mainly trying to understand how module scripts are structured and how to manage scripts and parts in folders via rojo syncing.

## Getting Started

To build from scratch, use:

rojo build -o "build.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `build.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```
